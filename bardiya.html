							<h1>Karnali	</h1>
							<p>The Karnali is Nepal’s longest and largest river and with its tributaries, it drains most of the Far West of Nepal – the ‘Wild West’ as many people call it. This bottom section of  the river definitely lives up to that name – the area that it flows through is wild and relatively unpopulated with some of the most pristine jungle scenery in Nepal, and abundant wildlife.
						The rapids are also pretty wild, with the river building to its climax in these lower  canyons.  Shortly after the sharp bend in the river speeds up, and there are big rapids, one leading into another, almost continuously down to the Seti River. </p>

					<h2>Front end developer</h2>
					<p style="color:black; background-image:linear-gradient(60deg,#29323c 0%,#485564 100%);">I am a front end developer. I design websites when I find online classes boring. I love surfing over internet and visit websites to try learn new ideas to create my own. Everything I've learned so far, I've learned from YouTube and other internet platforms. So far, college has taught me nothing but one thing and that is, money is the biggest of all. So, through web development, I'm willing to follow my interest and try to earn money. I have knowledge on javascript and I'm willing to learn reactJS. Thanks to my mom, thanks to my dad, thanks to my sisters, thanks to my dai, not now, but if I ever become whatever I'm dreaming of becoming. CHEERS !!!</p>
